# SQL_practice
I am working with the employee (emp) and department (dept) tables, where the emp table is the parent table, and the dept table is the child (referencing) table. I also use a java table specifically to practice the ALTER command.

I am practicing SQL using Oracle 10g, and I have successfully performed CRUD operations, aggregate functions, joins, and ALTER commands as part of DDL (Data Definition Language) and DML (Data Manipulation Language).
Parent table: Typically the table being referenced (has the primary key).

Child table: The table that contains a foreign key referencing the parent.

CRUD: Create, Read, Update, Delete.

DDL: Commands like CREATE, ALTER, DROP, etc.

DML: Commands like INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, SELECT.
